\"stand-alone\" units, but are different in some languages.\n *    \"Formatting\" units are declined according to the rules of the language\n *    in the context of a date. \"Stand-alone\" units are always nominative singular:\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do LLLL', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopad'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'do MMMM', {locale: cs}) //=> '6. listopadu'`\n *\n * 2. Any sequence of the identical letters is a pattern, unless it is escaped by\n *    the single quote characters (see below).\n *    If the sequence is longer than listed in table (e.g. `EEEEEEEEEEE`)\n *    the output will be the same as default pattern for this unit, usually\n *    the longest one (in case of ISO weekdays, `EEEE`). Default patterns for units\n *    are marked with \"2\" in the last column of the table.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMM') //=> 'Nov'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMM') //=> 'N'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'MMMMMMM') //=> 'November'`\n *\n * 3. Some patterns could be unlimited length (such as `yyyyyyyy`).\n *    The output will be padded with zeros to match the length of the pattern.\n *\n *    `format(new Date(2017, 10, 6), 'yyyyyyyy') //=> '00002017'`\n *\n * 4. `QQQQQ` and `qqqqq` could be not strictly numerical in some locales.\n *    These tokens represent the shortest form of the quarter.\n *\n * 5. The main difference between `y` and `u` patterns are B.C. years:\n *\n *    | Year | `y` | `u` |\n *    |------|-----|-----|\n *    | AC 1 |   1 |   1 |\n *    | BC 1 |   1 |   0 |\n *    | BC 2 |   2 |  -1 |\n *\n *    Also `yy` always returns the last two digits of a year,\n *    while `uu` pads single digit years to 2 characters and returns other years unchanged:\n *\n *    | Year | `yy` | `uu` |\n *    |------|------|------|\n *    | 1    |   01 |   01 |\n *    | 14   |   14 |   14 |\n *    | 376  |   76 |  376 |\n *    | 1453 |   53 | 1453 |\n *\n *    The same difference is true for local and ISO week-numbering years (`Y` and `R`),\n *    except local week-numbering years are dependent on `options.weekStartsOn`\n *    and `options.firstWeekContainsDate` (compare [getISOWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getISOWeekYear}\n *    and [getWeekYear]{@link https://date-fns.org/docs/getWeekYear}).\n *\n * 6. Specific non-location timezones are currently unavailable in `date-fns`,\n *    so right now these tokens fall back to GMT timezones.\n *\n * 7. These patterns are not in the Unicode Technical Standard #35:\n *    - `i`: ISO day of week\n *    - `I`: ISO week of year\n *    - `R`: ISO week-numbering year\n *    - `t`: seconds timestamp\n *    - `T`: milliseconds timestamp\n *    - `o`: ordinal number modifier\n *    - `P`: long localized date\n *    - `p`: long localized time\n *\n * 8. `YY` and `YYYY` tokens represent week-numbering years but they are often confused with years.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalWeekYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * 9. `D` and `DD` tokens represent days of the year but they are ofthen confused with days of the month.\n *    You should enable `options.useAdditionalDayOfYearTokens` to use them. See: https://git.io/fxCyr\n *\n * ### v2.0.0 breaking changes:\n *\n * - [Changes that are common for the whole library](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/blob/master/docs/upgradeGuide.md#Common-Changes).\n *\n * - The second argument is now required for the sake of explicitness.\n *\n *   ```javascript\n *   // Before v2.0.0\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1))\n *\n *   // v2.0.0 onward\n *   format(new Date(2016, 0, 1), \"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSxxx\")\n *   ```\n *\n * - New format string API for `format` function\n *   which is based on [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).\n *   See [this post](https://blog.date-fns.org/post/unicode-tokens-in-date-fns-v2-sreatyki91jg) for more details.\n *\n * - Characters are now escaped using single quote symbols (`'`) instead of square brackets.\n *\n * @param {Date|Number} date - the original date\n * @param {String} format - the string of tokens\n * @param {Object} [options] - an object with options.\n * @param {Locale} [options.locale=defaultLocale] - the locale object.
